# How does Ethereum gas work?


How does Ethereum gas work?
Ethereum gas is the cost of executing operations. Demand determines the price, with a base fee to incentivize transactions. The fee is burned, and miners receive tips.
Suggest Edits
In the previous article, we talked about the cost of operation codes in terms of gas. In this article, we‚Äôll take a look at the actual price of gas and understand what determines it.
EIP-1559
As many of you may know, the price of gas is something that changes with every block. Historically, gas prices on Ethereum have been unpredictable and at times, astronomically high making transactions inaccessible to most people.
However, In August 2021, after years of research and planning there was an EIP proposed to improve the calculation of gas prices on Ethereum, known as EIP-1559. Instead of covering the antiquated computation of gas prices from before EIP-1559, we‚Äôre just going to focus on how this works for the current state of Ethereum (post EIP-1559). If you want to learn more about the specific dynamics of EIP-1559 from a developer perspective, check out this resource hub.
Denomination Value in Ether Common Usage
Wei 10^-18 Technical implementations
Gwei (giga-wei) 10^-9 Human-readable gas fees
Gas Prices
The cost of operations on Ethereum is fixed and measured in the amount of ‚Äúgas‚Äù, however, the price of that gas (measured in Gwei) is ever-changing. We are going to understand how these prices are set so that you can be more informed about transaction costs.
‚õΩ
To view the latest gas prices you can check out Etherscan‚Äôs Ethereum Gas Tracker that gets updated in realtime.
With EIP-1559 the mechanism for setting the gas price has shifted from the previous model. We‚Äôll be discussing the current way gas prices are determined since the legacy mechanism has been deprecated.
Denominations of Ether
Just like dollars, Ether has different denominations that are used to express smaller values, particularly when describing gas costs. For example, similar to how 1 dollar is equal to 100 pennies, 1 ether is equal to 10^18 Wei (the smallest denomination of Ether) or 10^9 Gwei. Here is a table with the relevant denominations for ether and their common use cases:
You‚Äôll often see gas cost estimates listed in Gwei, however, if gas were to become much more or much less expensive we may see that denomination change to a different value.
‚úÖ
Gwei vs. Gas
Gwei is not the same value as ‚Äúgas‚Äù that we discussed as fixed cost for operation codes in the Intro to Ethereum section.
How is the price of a gas set?
Every block has a maximum amount of gas that can be used within it. This is how the number of transactions included within a block is determined. Every block has the capacity to use 30 million gas but has a target of 15 million gas in total.
The price of gas is determined by the amount of demand for transactions (or block space), where demand is measured by how filled the previous block was relative to the target gas. So let‚Äôs look at an example here:
The above screenshot shows two different blocks, one where block space was in high demand, and another where it was in lower demand. The network first sets a base fee, in an ideal world, this base fee would result in 15 million gas getting used in a block, no more, no less. However, what happens in practice is the actual gas can be above or below the target gas.
When blocks are above the target, the gas price (or base fee) is automatically increased, increasing the cost and barrier to entry for sending transactions and thereby reducing the number of people who are competing to fill the block. When the block is below the target the base fee is lowered to incentivize people to transact by lowering the barrier to entry for paying for a transaction.
This base fee helps users select an efficient gas amount that is likely to get their transaction mined rather than wasting tons of money on unnecessarily high gas prices like we‚Äôve seen in the past. These mechanisms also make it easy to predict future gas prices by looking at how ‚Äúfull‚Äù the previous blocks were.
We can actually see what this looks like in practice by visiting etherscan. Let‚Äôs take a look at block 16128921 for example:
we can see here that we are 57% below the desired gas target (only using 6.4 million gas instead of 15 million) and our base fee per gas is 12.044621651 Gwei. What do we think will happen with the next block? Will the base fee increase or decrease?
Here is a screenshot of block 16128922
We can see that the base fee decreased to 11.18 Gwei and by doing so this incentivized more people to send transactions and the gas used skyrocketed up to almost 30 million, 100% above the gas target! Now what do we think will happen with block 16128923? See for yourself!
What happens to the base fee?
Instead of going straight into the miners pocket, the base fee actually gets burned. There are several reasons why the base fee is burned instead of being given to the miner:
This prevents the miner from circumventing the payment of the base fee since they have to pay at least base fee of transactions for the block that the mine
Burning the Ether also creates deflationary pressure on Ether as an asset since supply is being taken out of the market
Setting the gas for your transaction
Turns out that when you are sending a transaction, you‚Äôre not actually setting the base fee value, but rather your setting the max fee which represents the maximum amount that you're willing to pay to get your transaction included. Luckily, unlike with the previous gas usage model, your transaction will only ever use the base fee** amount to execute, the rest of the value (max fee - base fee) will be returned to you.
As a dApp developer, you can actually create your own algorithm to determine how much gas to include in your transactions using endpoints like eth_feeHistory. If you‚Äôre interested in learning how to build this, check out How to Build a Gas Fee Estimator using EIP-1559.
How are miners paid?
Since the base fee is entirely burned, the new incentive for miners is now known as the miner tip. In a perfect world, the miner tip is the minimum amount that the miner is willing to accept in order to execute your transaction. This tip was originally set as 1gwei but can fluctuate depending on how full blocks are. Since the target gas value in blocks is 15M, in general, so long as blocks are hitting or near the target amount, there will always be room to add more transactions within a block. This is why the miner tip does not need to be insanely high to get your transaction included.
Typically when you set the gas for your transaction you‚Äôre setting a value called maxPriorityFee which is equal to the max fee + the miner tip . We‚Äôll learn more about sending transactions later on this week!

# What are Ethereum Accounts?


What are Ethereum Accounts?
Ethereum has two types of accounts: externally owned accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts. EOAs are like Bitcoin key pairs, while contract accounts are for smart contracts.
Suggest Edits
EOAs vs. Contract Accounts
There are two types of accounts in Ethereum: externally owned accounts and contract accounts.
Externally Owned Accounts üîë
Externally Owned Accounts (or EOAs for short!) are similar to Bitcoin private/public key pairs. In both models, the address and public key are associated to a private key via an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature.
However, the method to get from a private key to an address in Ethereum is different than Bitcoin. The resulting address in Ethereum is a 40-character hexadecimal string as opposed to a 26-35 alphanumeric string in Bitcoin.
üìò
Another difference is that Bitcoin addresses end in a checksum to ensure the address is typed properly. Ethereum addresses don't have a checksum by default, although EIP-55 introduced a capitalization scheme that can be validated by wallet software.
The biggest difference between EOAs and Bitcoin Addresses is that EOAs have a balance. This means that the global state of the blockchain actively tracks how much ether every active address on the network holds.
ü•∏
Minor clarification here: an active address refers to an address that has interacted on the Ethereum blockchain. There are technically 16^40 (or 2^160 if you're thinking in binary!) possible Ethereum addresses which can be generated.
These addresses are not included in the global state tree until they have interacted with the blockchain. Otherwise, this would be a massive amount of data stored! Take a look at EIP-161 which was implemented when flaws in the Ethereum system allowed an attacker to create 19 million accounts at extremely low gas costs.
Accounts vs UTXOs
To transfer value in Bitcoin we spend UTXOs. In Ethereum, there are no UTXOs. Instead, at the end of a transaction transferring ether, the transferred amount is subtracted from the sender's address balance and added to the recipient's address balance in the global state tree.
Compared to UTXOs, an account balance is quite straightforward, especially from an application developer's perspective. The EVM has an operation BALANCE that allows us to look up an addresses balance inside code running on the EVM. This is much simpler than adding all unspent transaction outputs that have a particular address as their recipient.
Each Ethereum address also contains a nonce. The nonce keeps a count of all transactions sent from that particular address. To understand why this is necessary, let's consider an example. üëá
Let's say you have 2 ether in your account and you want to send 1 ether to Bob:
JavaScript
{
  to: BOBS_ADDRESS,
  value: 100000000000000000 // 1 ether
}
You'll be able to broadcast this transaction to the network once you sign it with your private key. üîë üåê
At that point, with the current parameters specified, what's stopping Bob from re-transmitting this same transaction again to the network? ü§î
NOTHING üò±
To combat this, Ethereum tracks the number of transactions sent by an account, called the account nonce. Each time a transaction is sent, the nonce is incremented:
JavaScript
{
  to: BOBS_ADDRESS,
  value: 100000000000000000, // 1 ether
  nonce: 0x0 // this is the first transaction, nonce is zero!
}
If Bob tried to re-broadcast the transaction now, the network would reject it. Once the first transaction is successfully mined the miners enforce the rule that the nonce of your next transaction should be 0x1.
üí≠
You may be thinking: "What if Bob tried to increment the nonce himself?" But, of course, Bob would need you to sign the transaction after he incremented the nonce. The result of a digital signature does not leave room for the underlying data to be tampered with.
The word "nonce" simply means it's a number we're using once for its particular purpose. It's a rather ambiguous term. Accounts in Ethereum have a nonce that keeps a count of transactions to be used once per transaction. Blocks in Proof of Work have a nonce that allows it to randomly search for a valid hash to be used once in the search for that block hash.
To summarize, the difference between Ethereum EOAs and Bitcoin addresses is that active EOAs are stored with a balance and a nonce. Whereas in Bitcoin the client only keeps track of UTXOs which contain an owner address.
üìò
For more reasons why Ethereum chose accounts instead of UTXOs, it's best to refer to the Design Rationale document in the Ethereum wiki.
Contract Accounts
Finally, we broach the most exciting part of Ethereum: Smart Contracts! üíÉüèª
The term Smart Contract sounds pretty intimidating at first glance. Don't worry about the name, it's simply a program that runs in the blockchain execution environment.
As a developer, you would write a Smart Contract when you want to decentralize a program's execution. Smart Contracts are generally written in a high-level language like Solidity or Vyper. Once you've completed the code (and tested it thoroughly!) you can deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain. You can do so by running a transaction from your Externally Owned Account with the bytecode of the compiled smart contract.
This contract has its own account in that it also has a balance and address. The contract account cannot be controlled by a private key like a EOA. Instead, EOAs make transactions to call functions on the contract. From there, contracts can also make calls to other contracts synchronously. Once a contract is deployed, the code cannot be changed. However, the storage (persistent memory) of a contract can be updated through transactions.
üìò
A contract can store an address of another contract that it needs to interact with. Since the address is held in storage it can be updated through transactions. Therefore it's possible to upgrade a system by deploying new contracts and running a transaction to update references to point to the new addresses. This can be a bit of a challenging subject and is generally referred to as smart contract upgradeability.
üèÅ Wrap Up
In this article we discussed both types of accounts on Ethereum: Externally Owned Accounts and Contract Accounts. We talked about some of the differences between an account-based model and a UTXO model.
We also briefly touched on Smart Contracts from a high-level perspective, we'll dive into these concepts further when we start programming our own smart contracts!

# What are Ethereum nodes?


What are Ethereum nodes?
Ethereum nodes uphold network integrity and data. Full nodes store and validate all blocks and transactions locally. Ethereum uses Merkle Patricia Tries for data storage.
Suggest Edits
Ethereum nodes are what maintain the integrity and data on the network. There are several different types of Ethereum nodes that are participating in the network and are used depending on what type of data is needed.
Full nodes store and validate all blocks and transactions over the entire blockchain locally. When a smart contract transaction is executed, Ethereum full nodes execute all of the instructions in the smart contract. Together, full nodes determine whether the smart contract execution is producing the desired result. However, running full Ethereum nodes is expensive to and can consume a great deal of energy.
Luckily, Alchemy provides access to all archive data (from block 0) and the latest data (from the most recent and pending blocks) completely for free.
Understanding Ethereum Nodes
In the below video we will break down how nodes work, why they can be extremely challenging for applications at scale, and how to solve data consistency issues.
Bonus Material: Data Storage
We've talked about Ethereum Nodes storing information locally, although we haven't really talked about how they store the data locally. Let's take a closer look. üî¨
Ethereum stores data in Merkle Patricia Tries. . We already know this from week 2 content on tries :)
üìò
The term "trie" seems to have originated from the term "retrieval". It is used quite interchangeably with the word "tree" and is often pronounced the same way.
Merkle Patricia Tries retain the properties of the Merkle Tree. The root hash of the trie represents the entirety of its contents (if any data changes, the root is completely different). Also, data can be proven to be part of a Merkle Patricia Trie without providing all of the data.
In addition to the Merkle Tree properties, the Merkle Patricia Trie has some major performance benefits for storing large amounts of data. You can find the full specification of the Patricia Tree here as well as the design rationale here.
There are four types of tries used to store data in Ethereum:
State Trie - This is the global state of the Ethereum network. There is only one state trie and it is constantly being updated by transactions when they are mined into the blockchain.
Storage Trie - Each account has its own storage trie. This keeps track of all persistent variables within a contract account, also known as its storage.
Transactions Trie - There is one transaction trie per block and it contains all of the transactions in a specific order determined by the miner.
Receipts Trie - For each transaction, a receipt is stored that contains logs, gas used, and post-transaction state. This receipts trie stores all of that data.
That's quite a lot of trees! üòã
üëÜüèº Don't worry about memorizing this information; you will likely never need to interface with these tries directly. Either you'll invoke an opcode on the EVM when you write a Smart Contract or you'll use the JSON-RPC API (often with the assistance of a library) to interact with an Ethereum Node on a much higher level.
üèÅ Wrap Up
We discussed the potential issues you might run into with Ethereum nodes and how data is stored on full nodes, which is admittedly pretty intense! üòÖ
Much of the Ethereum system is designed around incentives on how these nodes are able to store and validate transactions, so this is an important thing to keep in mind! üß†
In upcoming lessons we'll be moving more high-level. We'll start to interact with these nodes using our Alchemy endpoint and learn to use libraries to make our lives easier as developers.

# Introduction to Ethereum Frontend Libraries


Introduction to Ethereum Frontend Libraries
Ethers.js and web3.js are popular Ethereum Javascript libraries for JSON-RPC protocol interaction. Ethers.js is lightweight, well-tested, and ideal for new projects.
Suggest Edits
Previous Section Recap


Virtually every web3 website, or dapp that you have ever used uses one of web3.js or ethers.js. Together, they are the two most popular Ethereum Javascript libraries that allow developers to interact with Ethereum or EVM-compatible blockchains using the JSON-RPC (Javascript Object Notation- Remote Procedure Call) protocol.
In other words, these are JavaScript libraries that allow you to do things that fundamental to almost every dapp: deploy smart contracts, create wallets, sign transactions, query the blockchain, etc. without having to make raw API calls to the blockchain.
One of the most common questions developers ask when starting out with web3 development is which library to use in their projects. In this guide, we will cover what ethers.js and web3.js libraries are, what they can do, and how they differ so you're able to make a choice depending on the requirements of your project.
üìò
If you're using Ethers.js but you also want access to certain Alchemy-specific features such as our NFT API, Enhanced WebSockets, Transact features, or Token API, read on!
We built a strict superset of Ethers.js that makes it simple to integrate your Ethers.js code into Alchemy's custom endpoints, called the Alchemy SDK. You'll get the same syntax and features as Ethers while gaining access to Alchemy's best-in-class infrastructure and Enhanced APIs.
Alchemy SDK Quickstart
Advantages of ethers.js
Ethers can do everything that web3.js can when it comes to interacting with the blockchain. In addition to that, it has a few more perks:
A Broader License
Ethers is available under the MIT License which not only allows developers to use it for free, but also allows modifications to it.
The latter is also allowed under the LGPL-3.0 license that web3 uses but it also forces you to release the source code containing the modifications.
Smaller Size
Ethers is an extremely lightweight library. It's only 77 KB compressed and 284 KB uncompressed.
ENS Compatible
Ethers knows how to parse ENS domain names by default. Therefore, you can replace a hexadecimal address with a .eth domain without any extra boilerplate code.
A Large Number of Test Cases
Ethers is extraordinarily well-tested, with close to 10,000 test cases; a significant chunk being written by Richard Moore himself. Ethers was a pioneer with respect to maintaining a well-tested Ethereum library (web3 has since managed to catch up to an extent).
Drawbacks of ethers.js
Ethers is a relatively new library. Hence, it is hard to find it in use in older, more foundational projects and companies. If you work or are planning to work in such a company, it may be worthwhile to spend more time learning web3.
When to Use ethers.js
Ethers is a fantastic library to use if you're building a new project. At the time of writing, the popularity (in terms of weekly downloads, beginner tutorials, and community support) has either surpassed or quickly catching up to that of web3.
Given the small size of the library, it is especially lucrative on the frontend as it can improve the performance of your website/app significantly.
Important ethers.js Class Abstractions
These are the core class abstractions that you will need to use to write scripts that interact with the Ethereum computer. These are also the base abstractions that the Alchemy SDK uses 1-to-1.
Provider: Represents any connection to an Ethereum node
Wallet: EOA (private key holder) with ability to sign and send messages to network
Contract: Represents a smart contract executable deployed on the network
Conclusion
Front-end libraries like ethers.js and software development kits like the Alchemy SDK make our life as developers extremely easy. Can you imagine what a pain it would be to be coding out all of our scripts in raw JSON-RPC?
So, web3 developers use front-end libraries that work to abstract the lower level away from them so that they can focus on streamlined development. This is the flow typical of web3 dApps:
Your dApp uses some front-end library that uses JSON-RPC under the hood to communicate with an Ethereum node (which is essentially, communicating with the entire Ethereum network).

# Ethereum Transactions - Pending, Mined, Dropped & Replaced


Ethereum Transactions - Pending, Mined, Dropped & Replaced
Explanation for different transaction states on Ethereum and other blockchains and how to handle each state to ensure your transaction gets mined in time.
Suggest Edits
TL;DR: Alchemy just released support for ‚ÄúDropped & Replaced‚Äù transactions in the Mempool Watcher, a browser-based user interface that allows web3 developers to browse, filter, and track transactions that were sent to the blockchain and help you debug pending transactions. With ‚ÄúDropped & Replaced‚Äù transactions, a new blockchain developer tool, it will be dramatically easier to understand when transactions fail, when they are replaced, and the current state of the mempool.
What is a Mempool?
A mempool, or memory pool, is a collection of pending transactions waiting for validation from a node before they are committed to a new block on the blockchain. Put simply, the mempool is a staging area for unconfirmed transactions in a node. Every blockchain node in the network has a mempool, and they all intercommunicate to share information about the latest pending transactions.
Mempools exist because only ~200 transactions can be confirmed per block, which are mined about once every 15 seconds.
As a result, pending transactions are broadcasted throughout the entire network of mempools with an associated gas price (i.e. the gas fees that the sender is willing to pay to complete their transaction). When a block is mined, the ~200 pending transactions with the highest gas prices are confirmed onto the blockchain by the node that mines the latest block.
If transactions fail to pass a series of validation checks or are submitted with too little gas, those transactions will eventually be dropped from the mempool.
What is a nonce?
A nonce is a 0-indexed number corresponding to the number of confirmed transactions sent by a particular address. That is, if an address has 0 confirmed transactions, it marks its first transaction with a nonce of 0, and the subsequent transaction it would like to send with a nonce of 1.
Every confirmed transaction by a particular sender address must have a unique nonce value. For example, if a sender submits two transactions with a nonce value of 1, only one can succeed.
Why do you need to set your nonce?
Nonces exist to protect against replay attacks.
For example, a transaction sending 20 coins from A to B can be replayed by B over and over to continually drain A‚Äôs balance if it didn‚Äôt have a nonce. Because transactions are submitted as hashed values, B could simply copy the hashed transaction published to the blockchain and re-run it over and over again.
However, if you set a unique nonce before creating the hashed transaction, it will prevent a replay attack, since every confirmed transaction must have a unique nonce value and subsequent identical transactions will fail.
It‚Äôs important for senders to set their nonce values correctly to ensure transactions have the opportunity to be confirmed because transactions that are submitted with an out-of-order or duplicate nonce value will be dropped from the mempool.
Nonces are also useful to guarantee ordering of transactions. For example, if a sender can submit 5 transactions with nonces from 0 - 4, they can expect that the transactions will be executed strictly in the order of their nonces.
What transaction lifecycle states can a mempool transaction be in?
Traditionally, mempool transactions fall into one of the following three buckets:
Pending Transactions
Transactions that have been submitted to the mempool and are waiting to be included in the next block mined by a miner. Learn more about debugging pending transactions..
Mined Transactions
Transactions that have been selected and are included in the latest block by a miner. The results of these transactions are then broadcasted to the entire network. Mined transactions can have two statuses:
Success
These transactions are successfully executed and modify state on-chain. The status field for a successful transaction is 0x1.
Failure/Execution Reverted
These transactions are not successfully executed but are still included in the block. This can occur if the execution process hits an error, runs out of gas, or encounters some other issue. The status field for a failed transaction is 0x0.
To check whether a mined transaction was successful or failed you can call eth_getTransactionReceipt passing in your transaction hash. In the payload, you will find a status field which will be 0x0 for failed and 0x1 for success.
Dropped Transactions
Transactions that have failed to be confirmed. This could happen because the transaction failed certain validation tests, the nonce was incorrect, the submitted gas price was too low and it timed out, or a number of other errors. Dropped transactions return their assets and gas fees to the sender, as if the transaction never happened.
Need help troubleshooting dropped transactions? Watch our tutorial on how to fix pending or stuck transactions with Alchemy‚Äôs Mempool Watcher.
What are Dropped & Replaced transactions?
A new category has become a common feature request by developers. When a transaction is dropped, the sender will oftentimes send a replacement transaction with the same nonce value to ‚Äúreplace‚Äù that failed transaction.
If the second transaction is confirmed onto the blockchain (e.g. by sending a new transaction with the same nonce and a higher gas price), the ‚Äúdropped‚Äù transaction will be moved into the new transaction status category known as ‚ÄúDropped & Replaced‚Äù.
Similarly, if multiple transactions are simultaneously sent with the same nonce value, typically the transaction with a higher transaction fee will be selected for confirmation onto a block. The other transactions will fall into the ‚ÄúDropped & Replaced‚Äù category.
This transaction status is useful for smart contract developers as it allows them to track which transactions have been successfully re-broadcasted to the blockchain network (‚Äúdropped and replaced‚Äù) and which dropped transactions still need to be re-broadcasted (‚Äúdropped‚Äù).
How to track Dropped & Replaced transactions
If you submit your transactions via Alchemy, we provide a convenient web3 developer tool to rapidly filter and explore transactions you‚Äôve recently submitted: the Mempool Watcher.
Before the Mempool Watcher tool was released, developers would have to track transactions via Etherscan (which was often unreliable), or by manually querying their nodes to retrieve the current state of the mempool and parse the response for the relevant transaction status details.


Using the Mempool Watcher, web3 developers using Alchemy can now see all their transactions in a single UI, and filter them by mined, pending, dropped, and dropped & replaced transactions. Builders can also search transactions by these filters:
Date of submission
Sender address
Associated transaction hash
Web3 developers can also use the Alchemy Notify API (webhook alerts for transaction activity) to:
Create notifications for dropped and mined transactions
Send transaction status notifications with Zapier
Integrate transaction notifications with a dApp
How do I start using the Mempool Watcher?
Sign up for a free Alchemy account today to access the Mempool Watcher, start tracking your dropped & replaced transactions, and access a host of other powerful blockchain developer tools! At our current pricing, you‚Äôll be able to send 1.2 million transactions to the mempool each month on our free tier - the most generous in the web3 ecosystem.

Parameters
UserOperation (Object): Contains gas limits and prices (optional). This can be either a v0.6 or v0.7 user operation but must match the version of the EntryPoint at the address of the second parameter.
entryPoint (String): The address to which the request should be sent. This must be one of the EntryPoint returned by the supportedEntryPoints method and should match the version of the userOp in the first parameter.
stateOverrideSet (Object): Allows changes to the state of a contract before executing the call. For example, you can modify variable values (like balances or approvals) for that call without changing the contract itself on the blockchain.
In more technical terms, the state override set is an optional parameter that allows executing the call against a modified chain state. It is an address-to-state mapping, where each entry specifies some state to be overridden prior to executing the call. Each address maps to an object containing:
FIELD TYPE BYTES DESCRIPTION
balance Quantity (Hex string) ‚â§32 Fake balance to set for the account before executing the call.
nonce Quantity (Hex string) ‚â§8 Fake nonce to set for the account before executing the call.
code Binary (Hex string) any Fake EVM bytecode to inject into the account before executing the call.
state Object any Fake key-value mapping to override all slots in the account storage before executing the call.

# Ethereum API Quickstart


Ethereum API Quickstart
How to get started building on Ethereum and using the JSON-RPC API
To use the Ethereum API you'll need to create a free Alchemy account first!

What is the Ethereum API?
The Ethereum API allows applications to connect to an Ethereum node that is part of the Ethereum blockchain. Developers can interact with on-chain data and send different types of transactions to the network by utilizing the endpoints provided by the API. The API follows a JSON-RPC standard. JSON-RPC is a stateless, lightweight, remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that is commonly used when interacting with Ethereum.
Getting Started Instructions
1. Choose a Package Manager (npm or yarn)
For this guide, we will be using npm or yarn as our package manager to install necessary packages.
npm
To get started with npm, follow the documentation to install Node.js and npm for your operating system: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
yarn
To get started with yarn, follow these steps: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install
2. Set Up Your Project
To kickstart your project, open your terminal and execute the following commands:
npm
yarn
mkdir ethereum-api-quickstart
cd ethereum-api-quickstart
npm init --yes
3. Install Axios
For making API requests, we'll use Axios, a widely-used HTTP client. Install Axios with the following command:
npm
yarn
npm install axios
4. Make Your First Request
You are all set now to use Ethereum API and make your first request. For instance, let's make a request to get the latest block. Create an index.js file in your project directory and paste the following code snippet into the file.
index.js
import axios from "axios";

const url = `https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${yourAlchemyAPIKey}`;

const payload = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  id: 1,
  method: 'eth_blockNumber',
  params: []
};

axios.post(url, payload)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('The latest block number is', parseInt(response.data.result, 16));
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
Remember to replace yourAlchemyAPIKey with your actual Alchemy API key that you can get from your Alchemy dashboard.
You can also make these requests on testnets like eth-sepolia or eth-holesky by just replacing the request URL:
Text
# Mainnet
https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/
# Sepolia Testnet
https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/
# Holesky Testnet
https://eth-holesky.g.alchemy.com/v2/
5. Run Your Script
To execute your script and make a request to the Ethereum network, run:
Shell
node index.js
You should see the latest block number outputted to your console.
Shell
The latest block number is 11043912

# Ethereum API FAQ


Ethereum API FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions about the Ethereum API
What testnet should developers use for Ethereum development?
All developers getting started on Alchemy should use Sepolia as their testnet of choice for development!
The Ethereum Foundation winded down support for the Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Kovan networks after Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake model and the Goerli testnet is also deprecated. To ensure that your testnet applications remain fully functional after the transition, we recommend using Sepolia, which will remain unchanged. Learn more at Choosing a Web3 Network.
What API does Ethereum use?
Ethereum uses the JSON-RPC API standard. The Ethereum JSON-RPC API serves as the backbone for the Ethereum network and powers any blockchain interaction. In aggregate, this API suite allows users to read block/transaction data, query chain information, execute smart contracts, store data on-chain, etc. Developers and consumers alike interact with Ethereum‚Äôs base JSON-RPC APIs to communicate with its decentralized network of nodes.
What is an Ethereum API Key?
When accessing the Ethereum network via a node provider, API services like Alchemy require an API key, which allows developers to monitor personal apps and access usage metrics.
While many Ethereum development environments have a set of default shared API keys, they are often throttled during periods of high usage leading to slower response times and a higher likelihood of request failures.
For the best development experience, we recommend that you sign up for a free API key!
With a dedicated API key, developers are able to:
access higher request throughput and increased concurrent requests.
query Enhanced APIs, gaining access to free archive data, logs, and higher-level API abstractions.
leverage individualized usage metrics.
Does Ethereum only use JSON-RPC?
The raw Ethereum client only uses JSON-RPC notation to encode remote procedure calls for interpreting requests and serving up responses. However, most developers use libraries that actually abstract away the JSON-RPC standard. Libraries like AlchemyWeb3.js wrap the base Ethereum JSON-RPC API to create more intuitive methods that make debugging and developing easier. Likewise, developers can find a host of different web3 libraries wrapper libraries spanning different programming languages like Javascript, Python, Golang, etc. which use JSON-RPC under the hood.
How does Alchemy's Ethereum API work?
Alchemy's Ethereum API gives developers and users access to read and write data to the Ethereum blockchain.
If you‚Äôre not familiar with how a blockchain works, here‚Äôs a quick recap:
The Ethereum blockchain is made up of blocks of data.
Blocks are stored on distributed Ethereum nodes.
Each node in the network serves as a ‚Äúmini-server‚Äù that allows its operator to read/write blocks of data.
Alchemy provides access to our higher-level infrastructure that allows developers to interface with the Ethereum network. With API access, Alchemy developers are able to send read/write requests to the blockchain.
We take care of the hard stuff so that developers can focus on their products!
Can you use Python for Ethereum?
Yes! While Javascript libraries have historically gained traction in the Ethereum development community, Python developers are also able to read and write the same data. One commonly used blockchain interaction library is web3.py which wraps many of the same methods featured in web3.js and Ethers.js.
For Python-based EVM development, Brownie offers a full suite of Web3 developer tools for compiling, testing, and deploying dApps similar to its peer environments Hardhat and Truffle.
How do I get the timestamp for a transaction?
There are three steps to get the timestamp for a transaction:
Grab the blockNumber field in your transaction object
If you only have the transaction hash, you can get the full object by making a request to eth_getTransactionByHash.
Get the block info by calling [ref:eth-getblockbynumber)
Grab the timestamp field in the returned block object
Here is an example request.
It's important to note that block numbers themselves are Ethereum's measure of time, however standard timestamps are available by looking at the block data.
How do I distinguish between a contract address and a wallet address?
A super easy way to distinguish between a contract address and a wallet address is by calling eth_getCode, which will return contract code if it's a contract and nothing if it's a wallet. Here's an example of both using our composer tool:
0x Contract Address
Vitalik's Wallet Address
What is the difference between DATA and QUANTITY?
The difference between the types ‚ÄúDATA‚Äù and ‚ÄúQUANTITY‚Äù is that ‚ÄúDATA‚Äù always comes specified with a required length (ex: 20 Bytes), so you'll need to make sure the string you pass in is the right length. In contrast, QUANTITY does not have length requirements.
For example given a parameter type: ‚ÄúDATA, 20 Bytes‚Äù, a valid input would be:
"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003"
note: every two hex characters make one byte, so that string is 0x followed by forty hex characters
However, if this were a QUANTITY, a valid input would be:
"0x3"
What is the Default Block Parameter?
The default block parameter is used to specify the block height in your request. It is an additional parameter on all of the following methods:
eth_getBalance
eth_getCode
eth_getTransactionCount
eth_getStorageAt
eth_call
The following options are possible for the defaultBlock parameter:
HEX String - an integer block number
String earliest for the earliest/genesis block
String latest - for the latest mined block
String pending - for the pending state/transactions
What methods does Alchemy support for the Ethereum API?
You can find the list of all the methods Alchemy support for the Ethereum API on the Ethereum API Endpoints Overview.

The chain ID returned should always correspond to the information in the current known head block. This ensures that caller of this RPC method can always use the retrieved information to sign transactions built on top of the head.
If the current known head block does not specify a chain ID, the client should treat any calls to eth_chainId as though the method were not supported, and return a suitable error.
You should prefer eth_chainId over net_version, so that you can reliably identify the chain you are communicating with.

Don‚Äôt have an API key?
Start using this API in your app today.
Get started for free
Returns a collection of historical gas information from which you can decide what to submit as your maxFeePerGas and/or maxPriorityFeePerGas. This method was introduced with EIP 1559.
Parameters
blockCount - Number of blocks in the requested range. Between 1 and 1024 blocks can be requested in a single query. Less than requested may be returned if not all blocks are available.
newestBlock - Highest number block of the requested range.
rewardPercentiles - (optional) A monotonically increasing list of percentile values to sample from each block's effective priority fees per gas in ascending order, weighted by gas used.
Returns
Object
oldestBlock - Lowest number block of the returned range.
baseFeePerGas - An array of block base fees per gas. This includes the next block after the newest of the returned range, because this value can be derived from the newest block. Zeroes are returned for pre-EIP-1559 blocks.
gasUsedRatio - An array of block gas used ratios. These are calculated as the ratio of gasUsed and gasLimit.
reward - (Optional) An array of effective priority fees per gas data points from a single block. All zeroes are returned if the block is empty.
baseFeePerBlobGas - An array of base fees per blob gas for blocks. This includes the next block following the newest in the returned range, as this value can be derived from the latest block. For blocks before EIP-4844, zeroes are returned.
blobGasUsedRatio - An array showing the ratios of blob gas used in blocks. These ratios are calculated by dividing blobGasUsed by the maximum blob gas per block.

# eth_estimateGas - Ethereum


eth_estimateGas - Ethereum
POST
https://{network}.g.alchemy.com/v2/{apiKey}
Generates and returns an estimate of how much gas is necessary to allow the transaction to complete. The transaction will not be added to the blockchain.
Don‚Äôt have an API key?
Start using this API in your app today.
Get started for free
üìò
Note
The estimate may be significantly more than the amount of gas actually used by the transaction, for a variety of reasons including EVM mechanics and node performance. Estimates are served directly from nodes, we're not doing anything special to the value so the rest of the network is likely seeing the same.
Parameters
Object - The transaction call object
from: DATA, 20 Bytes - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
to: DATA, 20 Bytes - The address to which the transaction is directed to.
gas: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. eth_call consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions. NOTE: this parameter has a cap of 550 million Gwei per request. Reach out to us at support@alchemy.com if you want to increase this limit.
gasPrice: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas.
value: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
data: DATA - (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. For details see Ethereum Contract ABI
QUANTITY|TAG - integer block number, or the string "latest", "earliest" or "pending", see the default block parameter.
üöß
Note
eth_estimateGas will check the balance of the sender (to make sure that the sender has enough gas to complete the request). This means that even though the call doesn't consume any gas, the from address must have enough gas to execute the transaction.
If no gas is specified geth uses the block gas limit from the pending block as an upper bound. As a result, the returned estimate might not be enough to execute the call/transaction when the amount of actual gas needed is higher than the pending block gas limit.
Returns
QUANTITY - the amount of gas used.

* `pending` - A sample next block built by the client on top of latest and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.
* `latest` - The most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client, this block may be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
* `safe` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù to be re-orged.
* `finalized` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, that has been accepted by >2/3 of validators. Cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is very unlikely to be re-orged.
* `earliest` - The lowest numbered block the client has available. Intuitively, you can think of this as the first block created.

Use cases for eth_getTransactionReceipt
Retrieve general information about a transaction: This can also be used to get general information about a transaction or to track the status of a transaction since the result will be null until the transaction is mined. However, using the Mined Transaction Webhook is a better option for tracking the status of a transaction. Unlike eth_getTransactionByHash, which returns null for unknown transactions, and a non-null response with three (3) null fields for a pending transaction, eth_getTransactionReceipt returns null for both pending and unknown transactions.
This call can also be used to get the contract address for a contract creation tx. However, if you use tools like Hardhat to deploy the contracts, you can get the address of the newly created contract by using the Hardhat toolbox.

Note
The receipt is not available for pending transactions.

This is one of the most commonly used API calls. It is used to read from the blockchain which includes executing smart contracts but does not publish anything to the blockchain. This call does not consume any Ether.
We can call any function of a smart contract using the eth_call method and it returns us any data that the function returns (in hex format). For read-only functions, it returns what the read-only function returns. For functions that change the state of the contract, it executes that transaction locally and returns any data returned by the function.
Calling the read-only function is a common use case because all read-only functions return something that we can read using this method.
Use cases for eth_call
eth_call is used to call read-only functions of a smart contract. For example, calling the balanceOf function of an ERC20 token contract.
How to Get ERC-20 Token Balance at a Given Block
How to decode an eth_call response
üöß
Starting from Geth 1.9.13, eth_callwill check the balance of the sender (to make sure that the sender has enough gas to complete the request) before executing the call when one of the following conditions is true:
the gas_price parameter is populated, or
the contract function being called (i.e. in data modifies blockchain state)\
In these two cases, even though the eth_call requests don't consume any gas, the from address must have enough gas to execute the call as if it were a write transaction because eth_call is being used to simulate the transaction.
Parameters
Object - The transaction call object
from: DATA, 20 Bytes - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
to: DATA, 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
gas: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. eth_call consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions. NOTE: this parameter has a cap of 550 million gas per request. Reach out to us at support@alchemy.com if you want to increase this limit!
gasPrice: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas.
value: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
data: DATA - (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. For details see Ethereum Contract ABI
QUANTITY|TAG - integer block number, or the string "latest", "earliest" or "pending" (see the default block parameter), OR the blockHash (in accordance with EIP-1898) NOTE: the parameter is an object instead of a string and should be specified as: {"blockHash": "0x<some-hash>"}. Learn more here.
Object - State override set
The State Override Set option allows you to change the state of a contract before executing the call. This means you can modify the values of variables stored in the contract, such as balances and approvals for that call without actually modifying the contract on the blockchain.
„Ö§
In more technical terms, the state override set is an optional parameter that allows executing the call against a modified chain state. It is an address-to-state mapping, where each entry specifies some state to be overridden prior to executing the call. Each address maps to an object containing:
FIELD TYPE BYTES DESCRIPTION
balance Quantity <32 Fake balance to set for the account before executing the call.
nonce Quantity <8 Fake nonce to set for the account before executing the call.
code Binary any Fake EVM bytecode to inject into the account before executing the call.
state Object any Fake key-value mapping to override all slots in the account storage before executing the call.
stateDiff Object any Fake key-value mapping to override individual slots in the account storage before executing the call.
Override Example:
Here's a simple code snippet in JavaScript that shows how you can use the State Override Set to mock an approval for a token transfer:
Override Example
// Import the ethers.js library
const ethers = require("ethers");

// The address of the DAI token contract
const dai = "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f";

// The address of the sender
const fromAddr = "0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe";

// The address of the recipient
const toAddr = "0x52bc44d5378309ee2abf1539bf71de1b7d7be3b5";

// The allowance slot on the DAI contract (this may differ from contract to contract)
const slot = 3; 

// Use the solidityKeccak256 function from the ethers.js library to calculate the index for the allowance mapping
const temp = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "uint256"],
  [fromAddr, slot]
);
const index = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "uint256"],
  [toAddr, temp]
);

// The stateDiff object to mock an approval
const stateDiff = {
  [dai]: {
    stateDiff: {
      [index]: ethers.constants.MaxUint256.toHexString(), // setting the allowance to the max value of uint256
    },
  },
};

// Create an instance of the Ethereum provider
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("Your-Alchemy-API-URL");

// The parameters for the eth_call method
const callParams = [
  {
    to: dai,
    data: "0xdd62ed3e..." // The method signature and arguments for the call
  },
  "latest"
];

// Call the contract method without state overrides
const call1 = await provider.send("eth_call", callParams);

// Call the contract method with state overrides
const call2 = await provider.send("eth_call", [...callParams, stateDiff]);

// Log the results of both calls
console.log(call1); 
console.log(call2);
Code Explanation:
We first import the ethers.js library, which provides a convenient set of tools for working with EVM chains.
Next, we define the address of the DAI token contract and the addresses of the sender and recipient.
We then calculate the index for the allowance mapping in the token contract. This involves using the solidityKeccak256 function from the ethers.js library to calculate a unique identifier for the mapping based on the sender and recipient addresses.
The stateDiff object is created to mock an approval, which is done by setting the state of the index in the allowance mapping to the maximum possible value (ethers.constants.MaxUint256).
An instance of the Ethereum provider is created. This provider will be used to make calls to the Ethereum network.
The callParams constant is created that specifies the parameters for the eth_call method.
The contract method is called without state overrides and the result is stored in the call1 constant.
The contract method is called with state overrides and the result is stored in the call2 constant.
The results of both calls are logged to the console.
The State Override option is mainly used for testing purposes, as it allows developers to temporarily modify the state of the chain to simulate specific scenarios and test the behavior of smart contracts.
‚ùóÔ∏è
Note
eth_call has a timeout restriction at the node level. Batching multiple eth_call together on-chain using pre-deployed smart contracts might result in unexpected timeouts that cause none of your calls to complete. Instead, consider serializing these calls, or using smaller batches if they fail with a node error code.

This is one of the most commonly used API calls. It is used to read from the blockchain which includes executing smart contracts but does not publish anything to the blockchain. This call does not consume any Ether.
We can call any function of a smart contract using the eth_call method and it returns us any data that the function returns (in hex format). For read-only functions, it returns what the read-only function returns. For functions that change the state of the contract, it executes that transaction locally and returns any data returned by the function.
Calling the read-only function is a common use case because all read-only functions return something that we can read using this method.
Use cases for eth_call
eth_call is used to call read-only functions of a smart contract. For example, calling the balanceOf function of an ERC20 token contract.
How to Get ERC-20 Token Balance at a Given Block
How to decode an eth_call response
üöß
Starting from Geth 1.9.13, eth_callwill check the balance of the sender (to make sure that the sender has enough gas to complete the request) before executing the call when one of the following conditions is true:
the gas_price parameter is populated, or
the contract function being called (i.e. in data modifies blockchain state)\
In these two cases, even though the eth_call requests don't consume any gas, the from address must have enough gas to execute the call as if it were a write transaction because eth_call is being used to simulate the transaction.
Parameters
Object - The transaction call object
from: DATA, 20 Bytes - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
to: DATA, 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
gas: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. eth_call consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions. NOTE: this parameter has a cap of 550 million gas per request. Reach out to us at support@alchemy.com if you want to increase this limit!
gasPrice: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas.
value: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
data: DATA - (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. For details see Ethereum Contract ABI
QUANTITY|TAG - integer block number, or the string "latest", "earliest" or "pending" (see the default block parameter), OR the blockHash (in accordance with EIP-1898) NOTE: the parameter is an object instead of a string and should be specified as: {"blockHash": "0x<some-hash>"}. Learn more here.
Object - State override set
The State Override Set option allows you to change the state of a contract before executing the call. This means you can modify the values of variables stored in the contract, such as balances and approvals for that call without actually modifying the contract on the blockchain.
„Ö§
In more technical terms, the state override set is an optional parameter that allows executing the call against a modified chain state. It is an address-to-state mapping, where each entry specifies some state to be overridden prior to executing the call. Each address maps to an object containing:
FIELD TYPE BYTES DESCRIPTION
balance Quantity <32 Fake balance to set for the account before executing the call.
nonce Quantity <8 Fake nonce to set for the account before executing the call.
code Binary any Fake EVM bytecode to inject into the account before executing the call.
state Object any Fake key-value mapping to override all slots in the account storage before executing the call.
stateDiff Object any Fake key-value mapping to override individual slots in the account storage before executing the call.
Override Example:
Here's a simple code snippet in JavaScript that shows how you can use the State Override Set to mock an approval for a token transfer:
Override Example
// Import the ethers.js library
const ethers = require("ethers");

// The address of the DAI token contract
const dai = "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f";

// The address of the sender
const fromAddr = "0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe";

// The address of the recipient
const toAddr = "0x52bc44d5378309ee2abf1539bf71de1b7d7be3b5";

// The allowance slot on the DAI contract (this may differ from contract to contract)
const slot = 3; 

// Use the solidityKeccak256 function from the ethers.js library to calculate the index for the allowance mapping
const temp = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "uint256"],
  [fromAddr, slot]
);
const index = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "uint256"],
  [toAddr, temp]
);

// The stateDiff object to mock an approval
const stateDiff = {
  [dai]: {
    stateDiff: {
      [index]: ethers.constants.MaxUint256.toHexString(), // setting the allowance to the max value of uint256
    },
  },
};

// Create an instance of the Ethereum provider
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("Your-Alchemy-API-URL");

// The parameters for the eth_call method
const callParams = [
  {
    to: dai,
    data: "0xdd62ed3e..." // The method signature and arguments for the call
  },
  "latest"
];

// Call the contract method without state overrides
const call1 = await provider.send("eth_call", callParams);

// Call the contract method with state overrides
const call2 = await provider.send("eth_call", [...callParams, stateDiff]);

// Log the results of both calls
console.log(call1); 
console.log(call2);
Code Explanation:
We first import the ethers.js library, which provides a convenient set of tools for working with EVM chains.
Next, we define the address of the DAI token contract and the addresses of the sender and recipient.
We then calculate the index for the allowance mapping in the token contract. This involves using the solidityKeccak256 function from the ethers.js library to calculate a unique identifier for the mapping based on the sender and recipient addresses.
The stateDiff object is created to mock an approval, which is done by setting the state of the index in the allowance mapping to the maximum possible value (ethers.constants.MaxUint256).
An instance of the Ethereum provider is created. This provider will be used to make calls to the Ethereum network.
The callParams constant is created that specifies the parameters for the eth_call method.
The contract method is called without state overrides and the result is stored in the call1 constant.
The contract method is called with state overrides and the result is stored in the call2 constant.
The results of both calls are logged to the console.
The State Override option is mainly used for testing purposes, as it allows developers to temporarily modify the state of the chain to simulate specific scenarios and test the behavior of smart contracts.
‚ùóÔ∏è
Note
eth_call has a timeout restriction at the node level. Batching multiple eth_call together on-chain using pre-deployed smart contracts might result in unexpected timeouts that cause none of your calls to complete. Instead, consider serializing these calls, or using smaller batches if they fail with a node error code.

# eth_estimateGas - Polygon PoS


eth_estimateGas - Polygon PoS
POST
https://{network}.g.alchemy.com/v2/{apiKey}
Generates and returns an estimate of how much gas is necessary to allow the transaction to complete on Polygon. The transaction will not be added to the blockchain.
Parameters
Object - The transaction call object
from: DATA, 20 Bytes - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
to: DATA, 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
gas: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. eth_call consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions. NOTE: this parameter has a cap of 550 million Gwei per request. Reach out to us at support@alchemy.com if you want to increase this limit.
gasPrice: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas. Note: most of our users (95%+) never set the gasPrice on eth_call.
value: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
data: DATA - (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. For details see Ethereum Contract ABI
QUANTITY|TAG - integer block number, or the string "latest", "earliest" or "pending", see the default block parameter.
üöß
Note
eth_estimateGas will check the sender's balance (to ensure that the sender has enough gas to complete the request). This means that even though the call doesn't consume any gas, the from address must have enough gas to execute the transaction.
If no gas is specified geth uses the block gas limit from the pending block as an upper bound. As a result, the returned estimate might not be enough to execute the call/transaction when the amount of actual gas needed is higher than the pending block gas limit.
Returns
QUANTITY - the amount of gas used.

Using blockHash is equivalent to fromBlock = toBlock = the block number with hash blockHash. If blockHash is present in the filter criteria, then neither fromBlock nor toBlock are allowed.
address
array of strings
Defaults to 0xb59f67a8bff5d8cd03f6ac17265c550ed8f33907
Contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.

String - Either the hex value of a block number OR block tags:
block number (in hex) OR
block tag (one of the following):
* `pending` (Not available on Ethereum) - A sample next block built by the client on top of latest and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.
* `latest` - The most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client, this block may be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
* `safe` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù to be re-orged.
* `finalized` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, that has been accepted by >2/3 of validators. Cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is very unlikely to be re-orged.
* `earliest` - The lowest numbered block the client has available. Intuitively, you can think of this as the first block created.

# eth_call - Polygon zkEVM


eth_call - Polygon zkEVM
POST
https://{network}.g.alchemy.com/v2/{apiKey}
Executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the blockchain.
Don‚Äôt have an API key?
Start using this API in your app today.
Get started for free
This is one of the most commonly used API calls. It is used to read from the blockchain which includes executing smart contracts but does not publish anything to the blockchain. This call does not consume any Ether.
We can call any function of a smart contract using the eth_call method and it returns us any data that the function returns (in hex format). For read-only functions, it returns what the read-only function returns. For functions that change the state of the contract, it executes that transaction locally and returns any data returned by the function.
Calling the read-only function is a common use case because all read-only functions return something that we can read using this method.
Use cases for eth_call
eth_call is used to call read-only functions of a smart contract. For example, calling the balanceOf function of an ERC20 token contract.
How to Get ERC-20 Token Balance at a Given Block
How to decode an eth_call response
üöß
Starting from Geth 1.9.13, eth_callwill check the balance of the sender (to make sure that the sender has enough gas to complete the request) before executing the call when one of the following conditions is true:
the gas_price parameter is populated, or
the contract function being called (i.e. in data modifies blockchain state)\
In these two cases, even though the eth_call requests don't consume any gas, the from address must have enough gas to execute the call as if it were a write transaction because eth_call is being used to simulate the transaction.
Parameters
Object - The transaction call object
from: DATA, 20 Bytes - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
to: DATA, 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
gas: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. eth_call consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions. NOTE: this parameter has a cap of 550 million gas per request. Reach out to us at support@alchemy.com if you want to increase this limit!
gasPrice: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas.
value: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
data: DATA - (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. For details see Ethereum Contract ABI
QUANTITY|TAG - integer block number, or the string "latest" or "earliest" (see the default block parameter), OR the blockHash (in accordance with EIP-1898) NOTE: the parameter is an object instead of a string and should be specified as: {"blockHash": "0x<some-hash>"}. Learn more here.
Object - State override set
The State Override Set option allows you to change the state of a contract before executing the call. This means you can modify the values of variables stored in the contract, such as balances and approvals for that call without actually modifying the contract on the blockchain.
„Ö§
In more technical terms, the state override set is an optional parameter that allows executing the call against a modified chain state. It is an address-to-state mapping, where each entry specifies some state to be overridden prior to executing the call. Each address maps to an object containing:
FIELD TYPE BYTES DESCRIPTION
balance Quantity <32 Fake balance to set for the account before executing the call.
nonce Quantity <8 Fake nonce to set for the account before executing the call.
code Binary any Fake EVM bytecode to inject into the account before executing the call.
state Object any Fake key-value mapping to override all slots in the account storage before executing the call.
stateDiff Object any Fake key-value mapping to override individual slots in the account storage before executing the call.
Override Example:
Here's a simple code snippet in JavaScript that shows how you can use the State Override Set to mock an approval for a token transfer:
Override Example
// Import the ethers.js library
const ethers = require("ethers");

// The address of the DAI token contract
const dai = "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f";

// The address of the sender
const fromAddr = "0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe";

// The address of the recipient
const toAddr = "0x52bc44d5378309ee2abf1539bf71de1b7d7be3b5";

// The allowance slot on the DAI contract (this may differ from contract to contract)
const slot = 3; 

// Use the solidityKeccak256 function from the ethers.js library to calculate the index for the allowance mapping
const temp = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "uint256"],
  [fromAddr, slot]
);
const index = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "uint256"],
  [toAddr, temp]
);

// The stateDiff object to mock an approval
const stateDiff = {
  [dai]: {
    stateDiff: {
      [index]: ethers.constants.MaxUint256.toHexString(), // setting the allowance to the max value of uint256
    },
  },
};

// Create an instance of the Ethereum provider
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("Your-Alchemy-API-URL");

// The parameters for the eth_call method
const callParams = [
  {
    to: dai,
    data: "0xdd62ed3e..." // The method signature and arguments for the call
  },
  "latest"
];

// Call the contract method without state overrides
const call1 = await provider.send("eth_call", callParams);

// Call the contract method with state overrides
const call2 = await provider.send("eth_call", [...callParams, stateDiff]);

// Log the results of both calls
console.log(call1); 
console.log(call2);
Code Explanation:
We first import the ethers.js library, which provides a convenient set of tools for working with EVM chains.
Next, we define the address of the DAI token contract and the addresses of the sender and recipient.
We then calculate the index for the allowance mapping in the token contract. This involves using the solidityKeccak256 function from the ethers.js library to calculate a unique identifier for the mapping based on the sender and recipient addresses.
The stateDiff object is created to mock an approval, which is done by setting the state of the index in the allowance mapping to the maximum possible value (ethers.constants.MaxUint256).
An instance of the Ethereum provider is created. This provider will be used to make calls to the Ethereum network.
The callParams constant is created that specifies the parameters for the eth_call method.
The contract method is called without state overrides and the result is stored in the call1 constant.
The contract method is called with state overrides and the result is stored in the call2 constant.
The results of both calls are logged to the console.
The State Override option is mainly used for testing purposes, as it allows developers to temporarily modify the state of the chain to simulate specific scenarios and test the behavior of smart contracts.
‚ùóÔ∏è
Note
eth_call has a timeout restriction at the node level. Batching multiple eth_call together on-chain using pre-deployed smart contracts might result in unexpected timeouts that cause none of your calls to complete. Instead, consider serializing these calls, or using smaller batches if they fail with a node error code.

# eth_estimateGas - Polygon zkEVM


eth_estimateGas - Polygon zkEVM
POST
https://{network}.g.alchemy.com/v2/{apiKey}
Generates and returns an estimate of how much gas is necessary to allow the transaction to complete. The transaction will not be added to the blockchain.
Don‚Äôt have an API key?
Start using this API in your app today.
Get started for free
üìò
Note
The estimate may be significantly more than the amount of gas actually used by the transaction, for a variety of reasons including EVM mechanics and node performance. Estimates are served directly from nodes, we're not doing anything special to the value so the rest of the network is likely seeing the same.
Parameters
Object - The transaction call object
from: DATA, 20 Bytes - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
to: DATA, 20 Bytes - The address to which the transaction is directed to.
gas: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. eth_call consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions. NOTE: this parameter has a cap of 550 million Gwei per request. Reach out to us at support@alchemy.com if you want to increase this limit.
gasPrice: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas.
value: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
data: DATA - (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. For details see Ethereum Contract ABI
QUANTITY|TAG - integer block number, or the string "latest" or "earliest", see the default block parameter.
üöß
Note
eth_estimateGas will check the balance of the sender (to make sure that the sender has enough gas to complete the request). This means that even though the call doesn't consume any gas, the from address must have enough gas to execute the transaction.
If no gas is specified geth uses the block gas limit from the pending block as an upper bound. As a result, the returned estimate might not be enough to execute the call/transaction when the amount of actual gas needed is higher than the pending block gas limit.
Returns
QUANTITY - the amount of gas used.

# eth_call - Arbitrum


eth_call - Arbitrum
POST
https://{network}.g.alchemy.com/v2/{apiKey}
Executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the block chain.

This is one of the most commonly used API calls. It is used to read from the blockchain which includes executing smart contracts but does not publish anything to the blockchain. This call does not consume any Ether.
We can call any function of a smart contract using the eth_call method and it returns us any data that the function returns (in hex format). For read-only functions, it returns what the read-only function returns. For functions that change the state of the contract, it executes that transaction locally and returns any data returned by the function.
Calling the read-only function is a common use case because all read-only functions return something that we can read using this method.
Use cases for eth_call
eth_call is used to call read-only functions of a smart contract. For example, calling the balanceOf function of an ERC20 token contract.
How to Get ERC-20 Token Balance at a Given Block
How to decode an eth_call response
üöß
Starting from Geth 1.9.13, eth_callwill check the balance of the sender (to make sure that the sender has enough gas to complete the request) before executing the call when one of the following conditions is true:
the gas_price parameter is populated, or
the contract function being called (i.e. in data modifies blockchain state)\
In these two cases, even though the eth_call requests don't consume any gas, the from address must have enough gas to execute the call as if it were a write transaction because eth_call is being used to simulate the transaction.
Parameters
Object - The transaction call object
from: DATA, 20 Bytes - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
to: DATA, 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
gas: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. eth_call consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions. NOTE: this parameter has a cap of 550 million gas per request. Reach out to us at support@alchemy.com if you want to increase this limit!
gasPrice: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas.
value: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
data: DATA - (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. For details see Ethereum Contract ABI
QUANTITY|TAG - integer block number, or the string "latest", "earliest" or "pending" (see the default block parameter), OR the blockHash (in accordance with EIP-1898) NOTE: the parameter is an object instead of a string and should be specified as: {"blockHash": "0x<some-hash>"}. Learn more here.
Object - State override set
The State Override Set option allows you to change the state of a contract before executing the call. This means you can modify the values of variables stored in the contract, such as balances and approvals for that call without actually modifying the contract on the blockchain.
„Ö§
In more technical terms, the state override set is an optional parameter that allows executing the call against a modified chain state. It is an address-to-state mapping, where each entry specifies some state to be overridden prior to executing the call. Each address maps to an object containing:
FIELD TYPE BYTES DESCRIPTION
balance Quantity <32 Fake balance to set for the account before executing the call.
nonce Quantity <8 Fake nonce to set for the account before executing the call.
code Binary any Fake EVM bytecode to inject into the account before executing the call.
state Object any Fake key-value mapping to override all slots in the account storage before executing the call.
stateDiff Object any Fake key-value mapping to override individual slots in the account storage before executing the call.
Override Example:
Here's a simple code snippet in JavaScript that shows how you can use the State Override Set to mock an approval for a token transfer:
Override Example
// Import the ethers.js library
const ethers = require("ethers");

// The address of the DAI token contract
const dai = "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f";

// The address of the sender
const fromAddr = "0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe";

// The address of the recipient
const toAddr = "0x52bc44d5378309ee2abf1539bf71de1b7d7be3b5";

// The allowance slot on the DAI contract (this may differ from contract to contract)
const slot = 3; 

// Use the solidityKeccak256 function from the ethers.js library to calculate the index for the allowance mapping
const temp = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "uint256"],
  [fromAddr, slot]
);
const index = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "uint256"],
  [toAddr, temp]
);

// The stateDiff object to mock an approval
const stateDiff = {
  [dai]: {
    stateDiff: {
      [index]: ethers.constants.MaxUint256.toHexString(), // setting the allowance to the max value of uint256
    },
  },
};

// Create an instance of the Ethereum provider
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("Your-Alchemy-API-URL");

// The parameters for the eth_call method
const callParams = [
  {
    to: dai,
    data: "0xdd62ed3e..." // The method signature and arguments for the call
  },
  "latest"
];

// Call the contract method without state overrides
const call1 = await provider.send("eth_call", callParams);

// Call the contract method with state overrides
const call2 = await provider.send("eth_call", [...callParams, stateDiff]);

// Log the results of both calls
console.log(call1); 
console.log(call2);
Code Explanation:
We first import the ethers.js library, which provides a convenient set of tools for working with EVM chains.
Next, we define the address of the DAI token contract and the addresses of the sender and recipient.
We then calculate the index for the allowance mapping in the token contract. This involves using the solidityKeccak256 function from the ethers.js library to calculate a unique identifier for the mapping based on the sender and recipient addresses.
The stateDiff object is created to mock an approval, which is done by setting the state of the index in the allowance mapping to the maximum possible value (ethers.constants.MaxUint256).
An instance of the Ethereum provider is created. This provider will be used to make calls to the Ethereum network.
The callParams constant is created that specifies the parameters for the eth_call method.
The contract method is called without state overrides and the result is stored in the call1 constant.
The contract method is called with state overrides and the result is stored in the call2 constant.
The results of both calls are logged to the console.
The State Override option is mainly used for testing purposes, as it allows developers to temporarily modify the state of the chain to simulate specific scenarios and test the behavior of smart contracts.
‚ùóÔ∏è
Note
eth_call has a timeout restriction at the node level. Batching multiple eth_call together on-chain using pre-deployed smart contracts might result in unexpected timeouts that cause none of your calls to complete. Instead, consider serializing these calls, or using smaller batches if they fail with a node error code.

# eth_estimateGas - Arbitrum


eth_estimateGas - Arbitrum
POST
https://{network}.g.alchemy.com/v2/{apiKey}
Generates and returns an estimate of how much gas is necessary to allow the transaction to complete. The transaction will not be added to the blockchain.
Parameters
Object - The transaction call object.
from: DATA, 20 Bytes - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
to: DATA, 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
gas: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. eth_call consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions. NOTE: this parameter has a cap of 550 million Gwei per request. Reach out to us at support@alchemy.com if you want to increase this limit.
gasPrice: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas. Note: most of our users (95%+) never set the gasPrice on eth_call.
value: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
data: DATA - (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. For details see the Contract ABI
QUANTITY|TAG - integer block number, or the string "latest", "earliest" or "pending", see the default block parameter.
üöß
Note
eth_estimateGas will check the sender's balance (to ensure that the sender has enough gas to complete the request). This means that even though the call doesn't consume any gas, the from address must have enough gas to execute the transaction.
If no gas is specified geth uses the block gas limit from the pending block as an upper bound. As a result, the returned estimate might not be enough to execute the call/transaction when the amount of actual gas needed is higher than the pending block gas limit.
Returns
QUANTITY - the amount of gas used.

* `pending` (Not available on Ethereum) - A sample next block built by the client on top of latest and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.
* `latest` - The most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client, this block may be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
* `safe` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù to be re-orged.
* `finalized` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, that has been accepted by >2/3 of validators. Cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is very unlikely to be re-orged.
* `earliest` - The lowest numbered block the client has available. Intuitively, you can think of this as the first block created.

# eth_createAccessList - Arbitrum

POST
https://{network}.g.alchemy.com/v2/{apiKey}
Arbitrum API - Creates an EIP2930 type accessList based on a given Transaction object. Returns list of addresses and storage keys that are read and written by the transaction (except the sender account and precompiles), plus the estimated gas consumed when the access list is added.
Resources
More info on EIP2930
accessList contains all storage slots and addresses that are read and written by the transaction, except for the sender account and the precompiles
An accessList can be used to unstuck contracts that became inaccessible due to gas cost increases.
Like eth_estimateGas, the gas estimate and accessList returned from this method is an estimation; the list could change when the transaction is actually mined
Adding an accessList to your transaction does not necessary result in lower gas usage compared to a transaction without an accessList

# eth_call - Optimism


eth_call - Optimism
POST
https://{network}.g.alchemy.com/v2/{apiKey}
Executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the block chain.
Don‚Äôt have an API key?
Start using this API in your app today.
Get started for free
This is one of the most commonly used API calls. It is used to read from the blockchain which includes executing smart contracts but does not publish anything to the blockchain. This call does not consume any Ether.
We can call any function of a smart contract using the eth_call method and it returns us any data that the function returns (in hex format). For read-only functions, it returns what the read-only function returns. For functions that change the state of the contract, it executes that transaction locally and returns any data returned by the function.
Calling the read-only function is a common use case because all read-only functions return something that we can read using this method.
Use cases for eth_call
eth_call is used to call read-only functions of a smart contract. For example, calling the balanceOf function of an ERC20 token contract.
How to Get ERC-20 Token Balance at a Given Block
How to decode an eth_call response
üöß
Starting from Geth 1.9.13, eth_callwill check the balance of the sender (to make sure that the sender has enough gas to complete the request) before executing the call when one of the following conditions is true:
the gas_price parameter is populated, or
the contract function being called (i.e. in data modifies blockchain state)\
In these two cases, even though the eth_call requests don't consume any gas, the from address must have enough gas to execute the call as if it were a write transaction because eth_call is being used to simulate the transaction.
Parameters
Object - The transaction call object
from: DATA, 20 Bytes - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
to: DATA, 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
gas: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. eth_call consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions. NOTE: this parameter has a cap of 550 million gas per request. Reach out to us at support@alchemy.com if you want to increase this limit!
gasPrice: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas.
value: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
data: DATA - (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. For details see Ethereum Contract ABI
QUANTITY|TAG - integer block number, or the string "latest", "earliest" or "pending" (see the default block parameter), OR the blockHash (in accordance with EIP-1898) NOTE: the parameter is an object instead of a string and should be specified as: {"blockHash": "0x<some-hash>"}. Learn more here.
Object - State override set
The State Override Set option allows you to change the state of a contract before executing the call. This means you can modify the values of variables stored in the contract, such as balances and approvals for that call without actually modifying the contract on the blockchain.
„Ö§
In more technical terms, the state override set is an optional parameter that allows executing the call against a modified chain state. It is an address-to-state mapping, where each entry specifies some state to be overridden prior to executing the call. Each address maps to an object containing:
FIELD TYPE BYTES DESCRIPTION
balance Quantity <32 Fake balance to set for the account before executing the call.
nonce Quantity <8 Fake nonce to set for the account before executing the call.
code Binary any Fake EVM bytecode to inject into the account before executing the call.
state Object any Fake key-value mapping to override all slots in the account storage before executing the call.
stateDiff Object any Fake key-value mapping to override individual slots in the account storage before executing the call.
Override Example:
Here's a simple code snippet in JavaScript that shows how you can use the State Override Set to mock an approval for a token transfer:
Override Example
// Import the ethers.js library
const ethers = require("ethers");

// The address of the DAI token contract
const dai = "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f";

// The address of the sender

Code Explanation:
We first import the ethers.js library, which provides a convenient set of tools for working with EVM chains.
Next, we define the address of the DAI token contract and the addresses of the sender and recipient.
We then calculate the index for the allowance mapping in the token contract. This involves using the solidityKeccak256 function from the ethers.js library to calculate a unique identifier for the mapping based on the sender and recipient addresses.
The stateDiff object is created to mock an approval, which is done by setting the state of the index in the allowance mapping to the maximum possible value (ethers.constants.MaxUint256).
An instance of the Ethereum provider is created. This provider will be used to make calls to the Ethereum network.
The callParams constant is created that specifies the parameters for the eth_call method.
The contract method is called without state overrides and the result is stored in the call1 constant.
The contract method is called with state overrides and the result is stored in the call2 constant.
The results of both calls are logged to the console.
The State Override option is mainly used for testing purposes, as it allows developers to temporarily modify the state of the chain to simulate specific scenarios and test the behavior of smart contracts.
‚ùóÔ∏è
Note
eth_call has a timeout restriction at the node level. Batching multiple eth_call together on-chain using pre-deployed smart contracts might result in unexpected timeouts that cause none of your calls to complete. Instead, consider serializing these calls, or using smaller batches if they fail with a node error code.

# eth_estimateGas - Optimism


eth_estimateGas - Optimism
POST
https://{network}.g.alchemy.com/v2/{apiKey}
Generates and returns an estimate of how much gas is necessary to allow the transaction to complete. The transaction will not be added to the blockchain.
üìò
Note
The estimate may be significantly more than the amount of gas actually used by the transaction, for a variety of reasons including EVM mechanics and node performance. Estimates are served directly from nodes, we're not doing anything special to the value so the rest of the network is likely seeing the same.
Parameters
Object - The transaction call object
from: DATA, 20 Bytes - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
to: DATA, 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
gas: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. eth_call consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions. NOTE: this parameter has a cap of 550 million Gwei per request. Reach out to us at support@alchemy.com if you want to increase this limit.
gasPrice: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas. Note: most of our users (95%+) never set the gasPrice on eth_call.
value: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
data: DATA - (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. For details see Ethereum Contract ABI
QUANTITY|TAG - integer block number, or the string "latest", "earliest" or "pending", see the default block parameter.
üöß
Note
eth_estimateGas will check the sender's balance (to ensure that the sender has enough gas to complete the request). This means that even though the call doesn't consume any gas, the from address must have enough gas to execute the transaction.
If no gas is specified geth uses the block gas limit from the pending block as an upper bound. As a result, the returned estimate might not be enough to execute the call/transaction when the amount of actual gas needed is higher than the pending block gas limit.
Returns
QUANTITY - the amount of gas used.

* `finalized` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, that has been accepted by >2/3 of validators. Cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is very unlikely to be re-orged.
* `earliest` - The lowest numbered block the client has available. Intuitively, you can think of this as the first block created.

# eth_call - Base


eth_call - Base
POST
https://{network}.g.alchemy.com/v2/{apiKey}
Executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the block chain.
Don‚Äôt have an API key?
Start using this API in your app today.
Get started for free
This is one of the most commonly used API calls. It is used to read from the blockchain which includes executing smart contracts but does not publish anything to the blockchain. This call does not consume any Ether.
We can call any function of a smart contract using the eth_call method and it returns us any data that the function returns (in hex format). For read-only functions, it returns what the read-only function returns. For functions that change the state of the contract, it executes that transaction locally and returns any data returned by the function.
Calling the read-only function is a common use case because all read-only functions return something that we can read using this method.
Use cases for eth_call
eth_call is used to call read-only functions of a smart contract. For example, calling the balanceOf function of an ERC20 token contract.
How to Get ERC-20 Token Balance at a Given Block
How to decode an eth_call response
üöß
Starting from Geth 1.9.13, eth_callwill check the balance of the sender (to make sure that the sender has enough gas to complete the request) before executing the call when one of the following conditions is true:
the gas_price parameter is populated, or
the contract function being called (i.e. in data modifies blockchain state)\
In these two cases, even though the eth_call requests don't consume any gas, the from address must have enough gas to execute the call as if it were a write transaction because eth_call is being used to simulate the transaction.
Parameters
Object - The transaction call object
from: DATA, 20 Bytes - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
to: DATA, 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
gas: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. eth_call consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions.

Object - State override set
The State Override Set option allows you to change the state of a contract before executing the call. This means you can modify the values of variables stored in the contract, such as balances and approvals for that call without actually modifying the contract on the blockchain.
„Ö§
In more technical terms, the state override set is an optional parameter that allows executing the call against a modified chain state. It is an address-to-state mapping, where each entry specifies some state to be overridden prior to executing the call. Each address maps to an object containing:
FIELD TYPE BYTES DESCRIPTION
balance Quantity <32 Fake balance to set for the account before executing the call.
nonce Quantity <8 Fake nonce to set for the account before executing the call.
code Binary any Fake EVM bytecode to inject into the account before executing the call.
state Object any Fake key-value mapping to override all slots in the account storage before executing the call.
stateDiff Object any Fake key-value mapping to override individual slots in the account storage before executing the call.
Override Example:
Here's a simple code snippet in JavaScript that shows how you can use the State Override Set to mock an approval for a token transfer:
Override Example
// Import the ethers.js library
const ethers = require("ethers");

// The address of the DAI token contract
const dai = "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f";

// The address of the sender
const fromAddr = "0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe";

// The address of the recipient
const toAddr = "0x52bc44d5378309ee2abf1539bf71de1b7d7be3b5";

// The allowance slot on the DAI contract (this may differ from contract to contract)
const slot = 3; 

// Use the solidityKeccak256 function from the ethers.js library to calculate the index for the allowance mapping
const temp = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "uint256"],
  [fromAddr, slot]
);
const index = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "uint256"],
  [toAddr, temp]
);

// The stateDiff object to mock an approval
const stateDiff = {
  [dai]: {
    stateDiff: {
      [index]: ethers.constants.MaxUint256.toHexString(), // setting the allowance to the max value of uint256
    },
  },
};

// Create an instance of the Ethereum provider
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("Your-Alchemy-API-URL");

// The parameters for the eth_call method
const callParams = [
  {
    to: dai,
    data: "0xdd62ed3e..." // The method signature and arguments for the call
  },
  "latest"
];

// Call the contract method without state overrides
const call1 = await provider.send("eth_call", callParams);

// Call the contract method with state overrides
const call2 = await provider.send("eth_call", [...callParams, stateDiff]);

// Log the results of both calls
console.log(call1); 
console.log(call2);
Code Explanation:
We first import the ethers.js library, which provides a convenient set of tools for working with EVM chains.
Next, we define the address of the DAI token contract and the addresses of the sender and recipient.
We then calculate the index for the allowance mapping in the token contract. This involves using the solidityKeccak256 function from the ethers.js library to calculate a unique identifier for the mapping based on the sender and recipient addresses.
The stateDiff object is created to mock an approval, which is done by setting the state of the index in the allowance mapping to the maximum possible value (ethers.constants.MaxUint256).
An instance of the Ethereum provider is created. This provider will be used to make calls to the Ethereum network.
The callParams constant is created that specifies the parameters for the eth_call method.
The contract method is called without state overrides and the result is stored in the call1 constant.
The contract method is called with state overrides and the result is stored in the call2 constant.
The results of both calls are logged to the console.
The State Override option is mainly used for testing purposes, as it allows developers to temporarily modify the state of the chain to simulate specific scenarios and test the behavior of smart contracts.
‚ùóÔ∏è
Note
eth_call has a timeout restriction at the node level. Batching multiple eth_call together on-chain using pre-deployed smart contracts might result in unexpected timeouts that cause none of your calls to complete. Instead, consider serializing these calls, or using smaller batches if they fail with a node error code.

# eth_estimateGas - Base


eth_estimateGas - Base
POST
https://{network}.g.alchemy.com/v2/{apiKey}
Generates and returns an estimate of how much gas is necessary to allow the transaction to complete. The transaction will not be added to the blockchain.
Don‚Äôt have an API key?
Start using this API in your app today.
Get started for free
üìò
Note
The estimate may be significantly more than the amount of gas actually used by the transaction, for a variety of reasons including EVM mechanics and node performance. Estimates are served directly from nodes, we're not doing anything special to the value so the rest of the network is likely seeing the same.
Parameters
Object - The transaction call object
from: DATA, 20 Bytes - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
to: DATA, 20 Bytes - The address to which the transaction is directed to.
gas: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. eth_call consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions. NOTE: this parameter has a cap of 550 million Gwei per request. Reach out to us at support@alchemy.com if you want to increase this limit.
gasPrice: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas.
value: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
data: DATA - (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. For details see Ethereum Contract ABI
QUANTITY|TAG - integer block number, or the string "latest", "earliest" or "pending", see the default block parameter.
üöß
Note
eth_estimateGas will check the balance of the sender (to make sure that the sender has enough gas to complete the request). This means that even though the call doesn't consume any gas, the from address must have enough gas to execute the transaction.
If no gas is specified geth uses the block gas limit from the pending block as an upper bound. As a result, the returned estimate might not be enough to execute the call/transaction when the amount of actual gas needed is higher than the pending block gas limit.
Returns
QUANTITY - the amount of gas used.

This is one of the most commonly used API calls. It is used to read from the blockchain which includes executing smart contracts but does not publish anything to the blockchain. This call does not consume any Ether.
We can call any function of a smart contract using the eth_call method and it returns us any data that the function returns (in hex format). For read-only functions, it returns what the read-only function returns. For functions that change the state of the contract, it executes that transaction locally and returns any data returned by the function.
Calling the read-only function is a common use case because all read-only functions return something that we can read using this method.
Use cases for eth_call
eth_call is used to call read-only functions of a smart contract. For example, calling the balanceOf function of an ERC20 token contract.
How to Get ERC-20 Token Balance at a Given Block
How to decode an eth_call response
üöß
Starting from Geth 1.9.13, eth_callwill check the balance of the sender (to make sure that the sender has enough gas to complete the request) before executing the call when one of the following conditions is true:
the gas_price parameter is populated, or
the contract function being called (i.e. in data modifies blockchain state)\
In these two cases, even though the eth_call requests don't consume any gas, the from address must have enough gas to execute the call as if it were a write transaction because eth_call is being used to simulate the transaction.
Parameters
Object - The transaction call object
from: DATA, 20 Bytes - (optional) The address the transaction is sent from.
to: DATA, 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
gas: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gas provided for the transaction execution. eth_call consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions. NOTE: this parameter has a cap of 550 million gas per request. Reach out to us at support@alchemy.com if you want to increase this limit!
gasPrice: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the gasPrice used for each paid gas.
value: QUANTITY - (optional) Integer of the value sent with this transaction
data: DATA - (optional) Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. For details see Ethereum Contract ABI
QUANTITY|TAG - integer block number, or the string "latest", "earliest" or "pending" (see the default block parameter), OR the blockHash (in accordance with EIP-1898) NOTE: the parameter is an object instead of a string and should be specified as: {"blockHash": "0x<some-hash>"}. Learn more here.
Object - State override set
The State Override Set option allows you to change the state of a contract before executing the call. This means you can modify the values of variables stored in the contract, such as balances and approvals for that call without actually modifying the contract on the blockchain.
„Ö§
In more technical terms, the state override set is an optional parameter that allows executing the call against a modified chain state. It is an address-to-state mapping, where each entry specifies some state to be overridden prior to executing the call. Each address maps to an object containing:
FIELD TYPE BYTES DESCRIPTION
balance Quantity <32 Fake balance to set for the account before executing the call.
nonce Quantity <8 Fake nonce to set for the account before executing the call.
code Binary any Fake EVM bytecode to inject into the account before executing the call.
state Object any Fake key-value mapping to override all slots in the account storage before executing the call.
stateDiff Object any Fake key-value mapping to override individual slots in the account storage before executing the call.
Override Example:
Here's a simple code snippet in JavaScript that shows how you can use the State Override Set to mock an approval for a token transfer:
Override Example
// Import the ethers.js library
const ethers = require("ethers");

// The address of the DAI token contract
const dai = "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f";

// The address of the sender
const fromAddr = "0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe";

// The address of the recipient
const toAddr = "0x52bc44d5378309ee2abf1539bf71de1b7d7be3b5";

// The allowance slot on the DAI contract (this may differ from contract to contract)
const slot = 3; 

// Use the solidityKeccak256 function from the ethers.js library to calculate the index for the allowance mapping
const temp = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "uint256"],
  [fromAddr, slot]
);
const index = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
  ["uint256", "uint256"],
  [toAddr, temp]
);

// The stateDiff object to mock an approval
const stateDiff = {
  [dai]: {
    stateDiff: {
      [index]: ethers.constants.MaxUint256.toHexString(), // setting the allowance to the max value of uint256
    },
  },
};

// Create an instance of the Ethereum provider
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("Your-Alchemy-API-URL");

// The parameters for the eth_call method
const callParams = [
  {
    to: dai,
    data: "0xdd62ed3e..." // The method signature and arguments for the call
  },
  "latest"
];

// Call the contract method without state overrides
const call1 = await provider.send("eth_call", callParams);

// Call the contract method with state overrides
const call2 = await provider.send("eth_call", [...callParams, stateDiff]);

// Log the results of both calls
console.log(call1); 
console.log(call2);
Code Explanation:
We first import the ethers.js library, which provides a convenient set of tools for working with EVM chains.
Next, we define the address of the DAI token contract and the addresses of the sender and recipient.
We then calculate the index for the allowance mapping in the token contract. This involves using the solidityKeccak256 function from the ethers.js library to calculate a unique identifier for the mapping based on the sender and recipient addresses.
The stateDiff object is created to mock an approval, which is done by setting the state of the index in the allowance mapping to the maximum possible value (ethers.constants.MaxUint256).
An instance of the Ethereum provider is created. This provider will be used to make calls to the Ethereum network.
The callParams constant is created that specifies the parameters for the eth_call method.
The contract method is called without state overrides and the result is stored in the call1 constant.
The contract method is called with state overrides and the result is stored in the call2 constant.
The results of both calls are logged to the console.
The State Override option is mainly used for testing purposes, as it allows developers to temporarily modify the state of the chain to simulate specific scenarios and test the behavior of smart contracts.
‚ùóÔ∏è
Note
eth_call has a timeout restriction at the node level. Batching multiple eth_call together on-chain using pre-deployed smart contracts might result in unexpected timeouts that cause none of your calls to complete. Instead, consider serializing these calls, or using smaller batches if they fail with a node error code.

* `pending` - A sample next block built by the client on top of latest and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.
* `latest` - The most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client, this block may be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
* `safe` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù to be re-orged.
* `finalized` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, that has been accepted by >2/3 of validators. Cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is very unlikely to be re-orged.

# Sonic Chain API Quickstart


Sonic Chain API Quickstart
Get started building on Sonic and using the JSON-RPC API
To use the Sonic Chain API you'll need to create a free Alchemy account first!
Introduction
Sonic Chain is an EVM-compatible, high-performance, scalable, and secure layer-1 blockchain. With over 10,000 TPS, one-second confirmation times, and low-cost transactions, it provides a robust platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and Ethereum-based deployments.
What is the Sonic API?
The Sonic API allows interaction with the Sonic network through a set of JSON-RPC methods. Its design is familiar to developers who have worked with Ethereum's JSON-RPC APIs, making it intuitive and straightforward to use.
Getting Started Instructions
1. Choose a Package Manager (npm or yarn)
Select a package manager to manage your project's dependencies. Choose between npm and yarn based on your preference or project requirements.
npm yarn
Begin with npm by following the npm documentation. For yarn, refer to yarn's installation guide.
2. Set Up Your Project
Open your terminal and execute the following commands to create and initialize your project:
mkdir sonic-api-quickstart
cd sonic-api-quickstart
npm init --yes
mkdir sonic-api-quickstart
cd sonic-api-quickstart
yarn init --yes
This creates a new directory named sonic-api-quickstart and initializes a Node.js project within it.
3. Make Your First Request
Install Axios, a popular HTTP client, to make API requests:
Bash
npm install axios
# Or with yarn
# yarn add axios
Create an index.js file in your project directory and paste the following code:
JavaScript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = 'https://sonic-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${your-api-key}';

const payload = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  id: 1,
  method: 'eth_blockNumber',
  params: []
};

axios.post(url, payload)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Latest Block:', response.data.result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
Remember to replace your-api-key with your actual Alchemy API key that you can get from your Alchemy dashboard.
4. Run Your Script
Execute your script to make a request to the Sonic mainnet:
Bash
node index.js
You should see the latest block information from Sonic's mainnet outputted to your console:
Latest Block: 0x...
Next Steps
Congratulations! You've made your first request to the Sonic network. You can now explore the various JSON-RPC methods available on Sonic and start building your dApps on this innovative platform.
