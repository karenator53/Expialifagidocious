### Introduction

This document outlines the frontend guidelines for our real-time wallet tracking application, designed specifically for internal individual investors. The application provides real-time insights into crypto investments across the Sonic, Base, and Solana blockchains. Users can input multiple wallet addresses, organizing them into groups for tailored tracking. The system also allows seamless tracking and analysis of wallet balances, transactions, profit and loss (PnL), and trades for copy trading. Users access the app through a single shared account, negating the need for individual onboarding.

### Frontend Architecture

Our frontend architecture leverages **React.js**, renowned for its component-based architecture, which enhances the building of complex and dynamic user interfaces. React.js facilitates the creation of reusable components, ensuring a consistent design and simplifying maintenance while supporting scalability. The architecture ensures high performance through React's efficient virtual DOM updates.

### Design Principles

Key design principles include **usability**, **accessibility**, and **responsiveness**. The application employs a clean, intuitive design for easy navigation and access to critical information, ensuring usability. Responsive design ensures optimal performance across various devices, including web, mobile, and desktop. Accessibility principles guide our development to create a UI that accommodates all users, including those with disabilities.

### Styling and Theming

We adopt a modular CSS strategy using pre-processors like **SASS**, coupled with the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology. This approach ensures maintainable and scalable styles, enhancing collaboration among developers. Central configuration files handle theming, enabling simple changes to color schemes and other UI elements, maintaining consistency throughout the application.

### Component Structure

The frontend's component structure is hierarchically organized, with each component fulfilling a distinct purpose. Components are designed to be reusable and modular, facilitating development and promoting code reuse. This structure aids in maintaining manageability by confining changes to specific components rather than the entire application. Modular components ensure straightforward and efficient updates.

### State Management

State management within the application utilizes **Redux** to manage the global state effectively, guaranteeing consistent data flow among components. Redux supports state management outside of React components, allowing components to direct their focus on rendering. This approach facilitates state sharing across the app, improving robustness with rapid and reliable state updates.

### Routing and Navigation

We implement **React Router** to manage routing, enabling smooth navigation without full-page reloads. The route structure reflects intuitive user flows, ensuring paths align with user expectations and interactions. Upon entering, users view a list view of wallets, fostering efficient organization and tracking.

### Performance Optimization

To optimize performance, we use techniques such as **lazy loading** and **code splitting**, which improve load times and resource utilization. Asset optimization, including minimizing CSS and JavaScript, further enhances performance, promoting smooth user interactions and experiences.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

Our testing strategy incorporates unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. **Jest** facilitates unit and integration testing, validating both individual components and their interactions comprehensively. **Cypress** enables end-to-end testing, simulating real user interactions to ensure correct application behavior in production-like conditions.

### Conclusion and Overall Frontend Summary

These frontend guidelines ensure the delivery of a robust, responsive, and user-friendly wallet tracking application. By leveraging **React.js** and a composed component architecture, employing **Redux** for state management, and adhering to comprehensive testing procedures, we create a high-performing and scalable frontend structure. This approach ensures our application stands out as an efficient tool for cryptocurrency management, meeting user needs while maintaining performance and usability.

In line with our full-stack integration intentions, the backend utilizes **FastAPI** with **Python**, and **Docker** is employed to facilitate smooth deployment. This cohesive integration of frontend and backend elements underscores our project's commitment to real-time, efficient data management and application responsiveness.
