### Introduction

The real-time wallet tracking application we're developing for internal individual investors is designed to monitor cryptocurrency wallets across the Sonic, Base, and Solana blockchains. The application's primary purpose is to provide users with profound insights into their crypto investments through tailored tracking features and real-time data accuracy.

### Frontend Technologies

For the application's frontend, we've chosen React.js, a robust JavaScript library ideal for building dynamic and intuitive user interfaces. React.js is known for its efficiency and component-based architecture, which ensures the interface remains responsive and easy to maintain. The design will focus on clarity and ease of use, offering users the flexibility to organize multiple wallet addresses into groups or categories for more tailored tracking. Users can view all grouped wallets collectively or filter them based on assigned lists/categories.

### Backend Technologies

We've opted to use Python with FastAPI for the backend, a decision influenced by FastAPI's high performance and ease of development. FastAPI offers asynchronous capabilities crucial for handling real-time requests without performance bottlenecks. Docker will be used for containerization, enhancing deployment scalability and consistency across environments. MongoDB remains our choice for data storage, providing a flexible, document-oriented database solution to handle user, wallet, and transaction data efficiently.

### Infrastructure and Deployment

The application's deployment will utilize Docker, ensuring independent of platform considerations whether web, mobile, or desktop. Docker's ability to facilitate containerized deployments aligns with our aim for consistent and scalable application delivery. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines will be implemented to automate testing and deployment processes, streamlining the roll-out of updates. Git will be employed for version control, fostering collaboration among the development team.

### Third-Party Integrations

Integrations with Sonic Labs and Sonicscan APIs are pivotal for real-time blockchain data access, essential for calculating profit and loss (PnL) as numeric values (utilizing color coding for clarity), tracking wallet balances, handling trades, and aiding potential copy trading strategies. Regular, optimized API calls will ensure the application remains within quota limits while providing real-time updates.

### Security and Performance Considerations

Though advanced security measures are not the primary focus, basic protocols are in place to protect data, especially considering blockchain integrations. The architecture balances real-time data fetching needs with API call cost-effectiveness, ensuring low latency and robust response times for optimal user experience.

### Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

The technology stack for this real-time wallet tracking application comprises React.js for the frontend, Python with FastAPI for the backend, Docker for deployment, and MongoDB for data management, alongside integrations with Sonic Labs and Sonicscan APIs. This stack supports scalable, real-time functionality while minimizing operational costs, providing precise financial insights. The design and tech choices ensure the application remains user-friendly and adaptable to evolving needs, setting it apart in delivering tailored cryptocurrency investment insights.
