### Introduction

The backend system of our real-time wallet tracking application is pivotal in managing the logic and data processing necessary to efficiently track crypto wallets on the Sonic, Base, and Solana blockchains. It processes real-time data, performs portfolio calculations, and supports features like user-defined wallet grouping and real-time trade detection, providing tailored tracking and analytical insights to users.

### Backend Architecture

Leveraging Python with FastAPI as our application server backend, we ensure a robust and high-performance architecture. FastAPI is chosen for its ability to handle high throughput and deliver fast request times, crucial for real-time applications. The use of Docker for deployment allows for seamless environment management, ensuring consistency across development and production.

### Database Management

Our data management needs are met by employing MongoDB for its flexibility in handling dynamic data structures, such as diverse crypto transactions. With MongoDB, we can efficiently index user-defined wallet groups, categories, and transaction histories for quick retrieval, ensuring minimal latency in data access.

### API Design and Endpoints

Following RESTful principles, our APIs are designed to be stateless and scalable. Key endpoints include:

*   **Wallet Tracking Endpoint**: Fetches and updates real-time wallet data.
*   **Profit and Loss Calculation Endpoint**: Computes PnL for user portfolios, showing initial investments, asset transfers, and current balances through intuitive numerical and colored indicators.

### Hosting Solutions

Hosting is implemented on scalable cloud infrastructure, specifically utilizing Azure Container Service. This ensures reliable service with automatic scaling capabilities to handle fluctuating loads efficiently. This cloud-first approach reduces operational overhead and improves responsiveness.

### Infrastructure Components

Key infrastructure components include:

*   **Load Balancers**: To distribute incoming request load and avoid server bottlenecks.
*   **Caching through Redis**: Provides rapid access to frequently-requested data, reducing API call loads and ensuring timely updates.

### Security Measures

Given the internal tool usage, strict security measures, such as data encryption in transit with TLS, are in place. Although user onboarding isn't implemented, basic API key authentication ensures that the system processes only legitimate requests, safeguarding operational integrity.

### Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The backend of this real-time wallet tracking platform is built for efficiency and scalability, using Python with FastAPI and Docker for robust deployment. It efficiently manages complex crypto data through MongoDB, providing users with real-time insights into their investments with negligible latency. The combination of state-of-the-art technologies ensures that the application remains agile, powerful, and responsive to the evolving needs of cryptocurrency tracking.
