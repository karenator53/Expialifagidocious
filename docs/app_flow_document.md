# Updated App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application is designed for real-time tracking of cryptocurrency wallets across the Sonic, Base, and Solana blockchains, specifically for internal use by individual investors.

Since the application is used internally, there is a single shared account that does not require an individual onboarding process. Users access the application via a direct link, entering with a password that opens a unified account tracking multiple wallets. This eliminates the need for roles or permissions management and simplifies the user experience.

## Main Dashboard Overview

Once authenticated, users encounter a structured list view of all monitored wallets immediately. This central features panel delivers aggregated wallet data, including real-time balance updates and transaction insights. The interface allows for categorization, enabling users to organize wallets into custom groups or lists for tailored monitoring. Grouped wallets are shown collectively, with options to filter or focus on specific categories, providing a personalized view.

## Profit and Loss Display

Profit and loss (PnL) specifics are prominent within the interface. For each wallet or category:

*   **Profit and Loss Indicator**: Displayed in green for gains and red for losses, reflecting real-time financial health.
*   **Initial and Current Balances**: Present users with the starting investment compared to the current valuation.
*   **Transaction Breakdown**: Highlights sales actions, including transitions to different assets, and remaining coin/asset amounts.

## Features and Functionality

Users manage wallets through intuitive options available on the dashboard. Key features include:

*   **Real-Time Data**: Continuous data pulls from APIs display transactions and balances dynamically.
*   **Trade Detection**: Alerts for new trade activities, allowing users to evaluate opportunities for executing similar trades.
*   **Seamless Navigation**: Users can easily switch back and forth between the dashboard, detailed analytics, and wallet groups.

*   **Customize Display**: Modify data representation settings, such as currency view or data sorting.
*   **Notification Preferences**: Adjust alert settings to suit their monitoring needs, focusing on high-priority updates.

## Error Handling and Continuity

In the event of erroneous wallet detail input or API call issues, the platform offers clear guidance and solutions. Error messages direct users to correct inputs or troubleshoot connectivity. Should API access be temporarily unavailable, cached data ensures that users retain access to the latest information without disruption.

## Conclusion and User Experience

By blending robust tracking capabilities with user-friendly navigation, it enables investors to keep abreast of their cryptocurrency holdings and exploit strategic trading options effectively.
