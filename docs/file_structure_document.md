### Introduction

A well-structured file organization is essential for our real-time wallet tracking application, providing a robust framework that enhances collaboration, maintainability, and scalability. The emphasis on real-time data processing capabilities for tracking wallets on the Sonic, Base, and Solana blockchains makes a clear and adaptable file structure critical for efficient development and deployment.

### Overview of the Tech Stack

Our application employs modern technologies: React.js for the frontend, Python with FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB for data management. Docker is utilized for deployment to ensure consistency across environments. Utilizing Sonic Labs and Sonicscan APIs informs our organizational strategies, and each technology influences the file structure, promoting a clean, modular architecture.

### Root Directory Structure

The project's root directory lays out several key directories to organize the codebase effectively:

*   **/src:** Contains all source code, both frontend and backend.
*   **/public:** Stores static assets for the frontend, like images and the primary HTML file.
*   **/config:** Houses configuration files for environment settings and external API details.
*   **/scripts:** Contains scripts for automation and deployment.
*   **/tests:** Dedicated to unit and integration testing.
*   **Dockerfile & docker-compose.yml:** Necessary for containerizing the application for deployment.
*   **requirements.txt:** Lists Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend.

### Frontend File Structure

In the `/src/frontend` directory, a React.js component-based structure is maintained:

*   **/components:** Reusable UI components that enhance modularity and reusability.
*   **/styles:** CSS or SASS files for styling the UI components.
*   **/assets:** Frontend-specific assets like images.
*   **/utils:** Contains utility functions shared across components.

### Backend File Structure

The backend follows an MVC-inspired structure, aligning with principles suited for FastAPI:

*   **/models:** Defines database schema and interaction logic.
*   **/routers:** Organizes API routes, corresponding to different application modules.
*   **/services:** Handles business logic, including API interactions and complex operations.
*   **/schemas:** Defines request/response models using Pydantic.

This organization supports clear separation of concerns and scalability.

### Configuration and Environment Files

Centralized configuration simplifies managing settings:

*   **/.env:** Stores sensitive data like API keys, loaded with dotenv.
*   **/config.yml:** Default settings for connections and environments, adaptable per deployment needs.

### Testing and Documentation Structure

Ensuring robust testing and documentation through:

*   **/tests/unit:** Unit tests for individual components.
*   **/tests/integration:** Tests that assess component integration.
*   **/docs:** Guides, API documentation, and system overviews.

### Conclusion and Overall Summary

The structured organization of files in our application, reflecting the integration of React.js and Python with FastAPI, underscores our focus on reliability and future-proofing. Streamlined configuration, testing, and documentation processes further position the project for seamless collaboration and deployment.
